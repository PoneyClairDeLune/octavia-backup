Octavia will never become a reality without help from the following people.

* **Eastern_Digital** for suggesting a better cross-platform MIDI support and being a tester. Without them, Octavia would've never been born.
* **NiceChord** for making easy-to-understand multi-lingual music courses, and providing video & audio references of tone generators (YAMAHA MU80, Roland SC-55).
* **Ham Seung-woo** for providing videos using MegaMID (inspiration of Octavia's default GUI) with audio references of real tone generators (YAMAHA MU90).
* **JayB** for providing video & audio references (YAMAHA QY70, YAMAHA QY100, KORG NS5R).
* **DearHoney** for providing video & audio references (KORG 01/W, KORG 05R/W, KORG AG-10, KORG NS5R, KORG X5D, Roland SC-155, Roland SC-55 mk. II, Roland SC-88 Pro), and providing some hard-to-find demo MIDI files.
* **GFHK-SDGM** for being a tester.
